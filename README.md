# Lumpyrem
Python package to interact with the LUMPREM software suite. Lumpyrem is very much a work in progress. User beware.

If you find a bug or think the software is not working as intended, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/rhugman/lumpyrem/issues).

# Introduction
Lumpyrem is a Python package that facilitates interaction with the [LUMPREM lumped-parameter recharge model](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.pesthomepage.org/software/lumprem.zip) and its ancillary programs that assist in setup, and provide a linkage between LUMPREM and MODFLOW 6.
It is intended to make setting up and running LUMPREM models easier, in particular if integrated into [Flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) workflows. 

LUMPREM requires daily inputs of rainfall and potential ET. Nonlinear relationships based on stored soil moisture are used to calculate recharge, runoff and actual ET. The parameters which govern these relationships can be adjusted by PEST. Numerous quantities of interest are recorded on LUMPREMâ€™s output file. These include residual daily ET (which can be reformatted for input to the EVT package of MODFLOW), irrigation demand, and boundary condition head. The latter is calculated using a parameterizable, nonlinear relationship between head and stored soil moisture. Heads calculated in this way can be assigned to MODFLOW boundary conditions after appropriate re-formatting.

# Installation
Lumpyrem requires LUMPREM, LUMPREP and LR2SERIES. Executables can be downloaded from the [PESTHomepage.org](https://pesthomepage.org/software-0). It is recomended these be placed in a folder in the environment path on your local machine. Alternatively, the executables may be placed within the workspace folder.

You can install Lumpyem from PyPi:
   
    pip install lumpyrem
   
Installing from the git-hub repository is recommended; the PyPi version lags behind updates in the git-repo.


# Documentation
Documentation is a work in progress. [Jupyter Notebooks are provided with simple examples of code functionality](https://github.com/rhugman/lumpyrem/tree/master/examples). 

LUMPREM and utilities are extensively documented by their developer.

# To do
* deploy documentation to readthedocs
* utility to read lumprem output and convert to Feflow timeseries/.pow files
* utility to write PEST template files **DONE**
* make OS independent

# Funding
Development of Lumpyrem has been supported in part by the Groundwater Modelling Decision Support Initiative (GMDSI). https://gmdsi.org/
