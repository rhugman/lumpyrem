# Lumpyrem
Python package to interact with the LUMPREM software suite.

# Introduction
Lumpyrem is a Python package that facilitates interaction with the [LUMPREM lumped-parameter recharge model](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.pesthomepage.org/software/lumprem.zip) and its ancillary programs that assist in setup, and provide a linkage between LUMPREM and MODFLOW 6.
It is intended to make setting up and running LUMPREM models easier, in particular if integrated into [Flopy](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy) workflows. 

Lumpyrem is very much a work in progress. User beware.
